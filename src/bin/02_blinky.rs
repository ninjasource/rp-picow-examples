//! This example tests the RP Pico W on board LED and USB serial port logging.
//!
//! This example is for a RP Pico W or PR Pico WH. It does not work with the RP Pico board (non-wifi).
//!
//! How to run with a standard usb cable (no debug probe):
//! The pico has a builtin bootloader that can be used as a replacement for a debug probe (like an ST link v2).
//! Start with the usb cable unplugged then, while holding down the BOOTSEL button, plug it in. Then you can release the button.
//! Mount the usb drive (this will be enumerated as USB mass storage) then run the following command:
//! cargo run --bin 02_blinky --release
//!
//! Why is it so complicated for a blinky? The led is physically connected to the wifi chip which is separate from the rp2040 mcu.
//! Therefore the wifi chip needs to be setup first and that is quite a procedure because we need to load its firmware and set the country locale martix.
//! We also need to setup the wifi task.
//! Other things that complicate this board are the fact that if you want to use the bootloader you beed to convert from elf to uf2 format using the elf2uf2-rs tool
//! The pico bootloader enumerates the USB device as a USB serial port is the button is not pressed on startup, otherwise as a USB mass storage device allowing you to copy firmware onto it.
//!
//! Troubleshoot:
//! `Error: "Unable to find mounted pico"`
//! This is because the pico is not in bootloader mode. You need to press down the BOOTSEL button when you plug it in and then release the button.
//! Then, if your're on linux, you need to mount the drive (click on it in your explorer and it should mount automatically).
//! Or run `run-automount.sh` to do it (see `.cargo//config.toml`)
//! Pressing CTRL+C or q in the terminal will terminate the program and restart the picow in boot mode
